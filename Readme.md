# Zhurnik - an app for keeping calendar-indexed notes

ATTENTION: this project is in a very early stage of development!

## Introduction

Zhurnik is a portmanteau word created from two Russian words:
zhurnal (a journal) and dnevnik (a diary).

Here is the code for a mobile cross-platform application, which
should (when implemented at least with minimal useful functionality)
allow to the user to create text notes, one per each calendar date.

The user interface should provide a calendar-like date picker, so
that the user can retrieve existing or create new records.

## Technology Stack

This is a mobile application, intended to be cross-platform,
and for this purpose I build it using
[React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
and [Exponent](https://getexponent.com/).

## Family of Apps

I am developing a family of applications under name Zhurnik
as my assignment works in EDENZ College.

The desktop counterpart is
[Zhurnik-Electron](https://github.com/yurivyatkin/zhurnik-electron)

## Project Management

I organize the work using a Trello board
